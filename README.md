# Episode Release Date Widget
A WordPress widget that tells your visitors when they can expect the next episode of a podcast.

## Current Version
0.9

## Install

Not yet submitted to the WordPress.org plugin directory. 
To install, download the episode-release-widget.php file to your computer. 
Visit your WordPress site's wp-admin, select Plugins > Add New, then upload the file.
Active the plugin, and the widget will then be available under Appearance > Widgets.

## How the Date is Chosen

If you select a custom date, that date will be displayed for the next episode, even if you also select the later options.

When no custom date is chosen, but a recurring schedule is selected, the plugin looks for your most recent episode then adds your selection to that episode's date. As you add new episodes, that date will update.

If your podcast episodes can all be found in a particular category, select that category in the settings. This will allow the recurring schedule to only regard that category as podcast episodes. You can then add new blog posts in other categories and not effect the date displayed.
